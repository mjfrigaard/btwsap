    - When writing R code, use base R functions, but follow the tidyverse style guide.     
    - Avoid using `for` loops and prefer functional programming patterns like `apply()` or `purrr`.    
    - When creating graphs/plots, use `ggplot2`. 
    - If writing R Shiny code, use `bslib` for all layout functions (unless explicitly  instructed otherwise).
    - If writing Python Shiny code, use shiny core (not express) to build apps and include explanations in comments. ",
